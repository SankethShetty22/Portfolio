# Portfolio
Hi, Warm greetings to all and welcome to my CAE portfolio. This portfolio will showcase and highlight different simulations, projects and case studies using Finite Element Analysis and Computational Fluid Dynamics. This portfolio is a work in progress and will be up to data as more reports and studies are addded. 

Finite Element Analysis, my work in FEA highlights, Linear elastic simualtions with case studies in mass optimisation, fatigue failure theories, mesh convergence studies, modal analysis, symmetry techniques, and simple fundamental mechancial problems (Axial loading- Compressive, Axial loading - Tensile, Bending Midspan loading, End concentrated loads).

Computational Fluid Dynamics
Projects
> NAAC profiles at different attack angles,  Currently in progress,
